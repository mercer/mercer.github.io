title: A Survey of Java Based eCommerce Software
---

It's 2014. The online shop software problem is solved, right? What if I want a java stack, is it solved? What about integration with [Authorized.net](https://www.authorize.net/)? It should be, of course, open source software.

While trying to answer thise questions, I took a look at the java based ecommerce software ecosystem. The old player [Apache OFBiz](https://ofbiz.apache.org/) and the new kid on the block [BroadLeaf](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/) stood out.

The Apache Open for Business Project
-------------------------------------
OFBiz is an ecosystem on its own. It has been around since 2007 and today if offers anything you'd want from a [business management software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_OFBiz). It has [authorized.net support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/OFBENDUSER/Apache+OFBiz+Business+Setup+Guide). The [code](https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/ofbiz) is available. The [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OFBIZ/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel) says OFBiz is an active project. The [quick start](https://ofbiz.apache.org/download.html).
